## **_3. Blockbuster Reborn API Backend Demo: CRUD Functionality üßë‚Äçüíª_**

<!--- ## How to use the API -->

<!-- Demo Goes Here -->

<br />

***Please also refer to the above video when using Postman üëÜ***

## How to run

**Open and run back-end API in IntelliJ:**

  1.	Clone API from GitHub (https://github.com/thinesan29/BNTA_Capstone_GroupProject):
        - In Terminal: `git clone git@github.com:thinesan29/BNTA_Capstone_GroupProject.git`
  3.	Create local database called ‚Äúmovies‚Äù: 
         -	In Terminal: `createdb movies`
  4.	Download and install IntelliJ
  5.	Open API in IntelliJ
  6.	Run API from `CapstoneBackEndAPIApplication` file:
        -	Check API is running by opening `http://localhost:8080` on your desktop browser.

#### To access the program, use `https://localhost:{port}/{endpoint}` - the default port is 8080.

Each model - Movie, Cast and MovieCastMember - have REST controllers that provide basic CRUD functionality, specifically Index, Show, Create, Update and Delete routes. The Movie and Cast models also have additional functionality, described below: 

- INDEX: 
  - `GET http://localhost:8080/movies` returns all books in JSON format and can be accessed via web browser
  - This method is available for all other models

- SHOW:
  - `GET http://localhost:8080/movies/{movieId}` returns movies with unique id = {id} and can be accessed via web browser

- CREATE:
  - `POST http://localhost:8080/movies` creates a movie with a unique id, and returns the created movie. 
  - Attributes of this new movie must be sent within the request body in Postman.

- UPDATE:
  - `PUT http://localhost:8080/movies/{movieId}` updates movies with unique id = {id} and returns the updated book. 
  - All attributes, changed or not, must be included in the request body in Postman.

- DELETE:
  - `DELETE http://localhost:8080/movies/{movieId}` deletes movie with unique id = {id}. 
  - This must be done in Postman. If delete request is successful, Http status 202 - no content - is returned.
  
### Filters and Sort
  
The movie model contains filters and a sort that allow the user to narrow their search. Filters can be applied based on genre and language. Movie can also be sorted by cast, rating and review.

*This can be found in the "Blockbuster Reborn Component Initial Diagram.png" file.*
