## How to run

**Open and run back-end API in IntelliJ:**

  1.	Clone API from GitHub (https://github.com/thinesan29/BNTA_Capstone_GroupProject):
        - In Terminal: `git clone git@github.com:thinesan29/BNTA_Capstone_GroupProject.git`
  3.	Create local database called ‚Äúmovies‚Äù: 
         -	In Terminal: `createdb movies`
  4.	Download and install IntelliJ
  5.	Open API in IntelliJ
  6.	Run API from `CapstoneBackEndAPIApplication` file:
        -	Check API is running by opening `http://localhost:8080` on your desktop browser.

#### To access the program, use `https://localhost:{port}/{endpoint}` - the default port is 8080.

Each model - Movie, Cast and MovieCastMember - have REST controllers that provide basic CRUD functionality, specifically Index, Show, Create, Update and Delete routes. The Movie and Cast models also have additional functionality, described below:

### 2. POST (CREATE)

**2.1 POST New Movies**:<br>
``````
Method: POST 
Endpoint : /movies
URL: http://localhost:8080/movies
```````

The request body must be a JSON object containing the title,duration,watchList,review,rating,trailer,language and genre. The language and genre enum values are all listed in the API BackEnd Project Description section. If the request is successful, it will respond with a status code of 201 (Created) and the newly created Movie object in the response body.

In Postman, select Body -> JSON -> raw  and enter the following for the request body: 
```````
{
    "id": 31,
    "title": "Spider-Man No Way Home",
    "duration": 166,
    "watchList": false,
    "review": "Good",
    "rating": 8,
    "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfVOs4VSpmA",
    "language": "ENGLISH",
    "genre": "ACTION"
}
```````

In this example, the language enum value is "ENGLISH" and the genre enum is "ACTION" . If you want to use other examples, please refer to the listed language and genre enum values in the BackEnd Project description. Anything not on the list will NOT work.Please Note that language enum and genre enum must be all written in uppercase letters.

    "name":"Tom Holland",
    "age": 26,
